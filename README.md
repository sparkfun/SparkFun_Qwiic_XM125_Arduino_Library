The [SparkFun Qwiic Soil Moisture Sensor (SEN-17731)](https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-qwiic-soil-moisture-sensor.html) is a simple breakout for measuring the moisture in soil and similar materials. The soil moisture sensor is pretty straightforward to use. The two large, exposed pads function as probes for the sensor, together acting as a variable resistor. The more water that is in the soil means the better the conductivity between the pads will be, resulting in a lower resistance and a higher SIG out.
